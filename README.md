#### Proposal:
Coming from a more recent self-taught background in electronics and programming,
mainly purposed for crafting audio software and instruments, and a formal background in
percussion and ceramic art, I have recently sought the assistance of an academic setting to help
further my understanding of electronics, and computation with a focus on computer vision, and
predictive data-modeling. The focus of my work could “loosely” be defined as an exploration of
primal, less-recognized human emotions and experiences, through disorienting audio and visual
content. I take influence from a fast paced culture, bustling urban spaces, and the impact of
abrupt personal connections during daily commuting. I hope to spend my time at R&D over the
dates May 14th – May 17th 2018, generating and recording audio and visual content using a
modular synthesizer, field recorder, and miscellaneous electronics while implementing
concepts pertaining to my academic field of study. Specific processes I hope to implement
during this residency are: field-recording, sound design, DSP-scripting, livecoding, and 3D
graphic design. In addition to the aforementioned inspiration, I hope to also make a deep
connection with the space provided, experiences of surrounding city life, and my loving hosts.
